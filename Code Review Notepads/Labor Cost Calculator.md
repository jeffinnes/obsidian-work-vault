- [x] #25

## Needed Changes

- [ ] Staff Management > Let's flip Job Title Order (See the snip from the payroll scheduling app below)
- [ ] Staff Management > When a required field isn't filled in, the error message doesn't indicate what is wrong. (i.e. missing job title or name)
- [ ] Staff Management > After looking at some of the existing schedules, it seems that the stores are sorting their staff by FT/PT status and then the position hierarchy. We should replicate that.
- [ ] Staff Management > Leading zeros on the daily hours value are not being trimmed like they are for the hourly wage values
- [ ] Staff Management > The employee order seems to change when the "save changes" button is used, but refreshing the page restores the order.
