- How did you get started working at Buffalo Exchange?

I was a recent UofA grad with my shiny new IT degree and came across the job ad for an IT tech position. I was surprised that the two Tucson locations could need an actual IT department but I figured it was worth a shot. I had been shopping both locations since the early 2000s so I knew I aligned with Buffalo’s sustainability efforts. Plus I was leaving GameStop to get into IT, so I was pretty familiar with the “buy, sell, trade” business model which made the career transition less intimidating.

  

- Can you tell us a little about your Buffalo journey?

I joined the IT side of the herd, in early 2015, as an IT Technician. Pretty early on I got assigned to sit in on meetings between Marketing and the agency that was rebuilding our website at the time. I was mostly there to see to it that Marketing had whatever they needed on the server side and to make sure that the agency folks weren’t trying to be sneaky with a bunch of technobabble. I needed to get up to speed on how to navigate the web dev world so I worked with my managers to set time aside to read some beginner guides and do hands-on web development training courses. Over the next couple of years, my passion for web dev grew and I started spotting tedious or error-prone tasks that could be replaced or improved with web apps. I asked for and was given, the opportunity to build out a few things for IT and that quickly turned into me building SCARF and the Security Change Form, which led to us getting another tech involved.

In late 2018, it became obvious that we needed to manage the dev team’s projects a little differently than other IT projects. I had somewhat fallen into the role without realizing it, and in 2019 I made the transition into a management role. Since then I’ve been leading the dev team in our mission of crafting digital tools that simplify workflows, make daily tasks easier, and when possible more enjoyable.

  

- What do you love most about working at Buffalo? What has kept you here all these years?

Phew, this is a hard one. There are lots of things I like about, how we can show up as our unique selves, our environmental and community impact, and the five points of power. These are all great, but what I really love about working at Buffalo is that our ideas matter. I’ve worked at a number of companies where all ideas came from the top down and most of us had no voice. But at Buffalo, I’ve seen thoughtfully presented ideas come from all levels, get implemented, and have a real impact.

  

- Three words to describe yourself?

I’m not sure if I can muster the ego to describe myself with these words, but I try to live in a way that will lead _others_ to describe me as empathetic, genuine, and inquisitive.

  

- What's in your Spotify (or music platform of choice) rotation right now?

When I’m looking for deep focus while coding I reach for Chillwave or Lo-Fi playlists (specifically Lord of the Rings Lo-fi, look it up). I tend to listen to podcasts more than music though.

My current top podcast picks are 'Syntax' and 'The Last Tech Podcast' for coding/tech, 'Myths and Legends,' 'Fictional,' and 'Story Break' for storytelling, 'Hidden Brain' and 'Curiosity Daily' to feed the brain, and 'The Missing Cryptoqueen' and 'Opportunity Cost' to scratch the investigative journalism itch.

  

- Favorite coding language?

My equally ranked top three favorites are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Those three coding languages are the foundation of everything you see and do on the web. There is a lot of complexity and nuance the deeper you go into web dev, but it’s sometimes shocking the cool things people do with the basics. The web is for everyone so if you’ve ever been curious about building in the web, check out [freecodecamp.org](http://freecodecamp.org) or [codecademy.com](http://codecademy.com/) and build something silly and fun!

  

- What's one thing you can't go to work without?

My sticker-laden laptop, Yeti mug filled with coffee, and Perplexity (my AI search assistant of choice).

- Any favorite Buffalo memory over the years?

In February 2016 I got a call one Sunday morning from the Chelsea store because a water line had frozen and then burst directly above their server shelf. The whole store was down and none of the equipment was recoverable. We decided to make an emergency trip with an entirely new set of equipment and for some reason, I decided to volunteer to go. Winging it with half a plan is not my normal cup of tea, and yet, there I was on an overnight flight to NYC with more computer gear than clothes in my suitcase. Did you know Converse are not appropriate snow shoes? Justin Goellner was the Chelsea manager at the time and met me at an absurdly early hour for coffee, so I wouldn’t have to wander the streets alone.

It was hard work and long hours to get everything fixed but the store was great and we turned a really stressful situation into a great adventure!
