### Five points of power examples

Ask for what you want

Training, tools, projects, project timelines

Keep your agreements

Completing work detailed in the Scope

Follow-up communication

Having demos ready when agreed

If you need to follow-up on something from a discussion with stakeholder, follow-up asap or communicate the delay preemptively

Speak the truth

Discuss when mid-project requests cause scope creep

Let stakeholders know if a deliverable isn’t going to be met as early as possible

e.g. If a demo isn’t going to be 100% ready for some reason. The stakeholder may wish to postpone or may be okay with a partial demo, but it sets correct expectations.

Be accountable for your own experiences

Be honest when reflecting on why something didn’t get done correctly, on time, or “failed” (like a deployment issue or crashing app)

We can improve on truth, even if it’s uncomfortable

Give 100% attention when interacting with others

Make sure we understand requirements before taking action.

Address everything a stakeholder brings up

Come to the conversation with as much preemptive knowledge as possible

Understanding the user’s challenges/needs will help you prepare for what they may ask

## Current projects

For now just stay focused of Store Reports QoL

There isn’t anything further for you to do on the Warehouse UPS project right now, I’ll let you know when we have some next steps

Google Drive: Because we are paying so much for Google now and Microsoft would be very expensive, Sabrina wants IT to focus on leveraging Google Docs and Sheet as replacement for form templates as the primary solution. Apps will be the answer for when a form has too much complexity or would benefit from the workflow improvements of an app. No Google Drive tasks for the Dev team right, now but they will likely be coming to help with research, implementation, and documentation.

In the mean time we have the project backlog to focus on. Loren and I are in the process of evaluating priorities. Again.

  

## Feedback

### From management to you:

Make sure things like the Excel AI tool go through IT management. We are going to come across cool thing and it’s hard not to share the excitement with the people that would use it, but Loren doesn’t like to be playing catch-up.
