Doing a really good job. Great display of skill.

  

### Your feedback for me (about me or the team in general):

Would like to get advanced SQL stuff off his plate, it’s a lot of stress and should be Celerant responsibility.

Worried about being stuck as a jack of all trades.

Can I confirm that Alex is the primary on JAMS

Need a daily priority list

## Goals

Short: Get a bit better at CSS

Long: Get good enough at full stack to promote to Dev II

  

## Professional Development

Experiment with keeping a work log

Take a deeper dive into CSS

  

## Any other issues or concerns

none at this time

    - Keep trying to push knowledge boundaries

## Any other issues or concerns

- [x] For Promo re-read employee handbook

  

### Five points of power examples

Ask for what you want

Training, tools, projects, project timelines

Keep your agreements

Completing work detailed in the Scope

Follow-up communication

Having demos ready when agreed

If you need to follow-up on something from a discussion with stakeholder, follow-up asap or communicate the delay preemptively

Speak the truth

Discuss when mid-project requests cause scope creep

Let stakeholders know if a deliverable isn’t going to be met as early as possible

e.g. If a demo isn’t going to be 100% ready for some reason. The stakeholder may wish to postpone or may be okay with a partial demo, but it sets correct expectations.

Be accountable for your own experiences

Be honest when reflecting on why something didn’t get done correctly, on time, or “failed” (like a deployment issue or crashing app)

We can improve on truth, even if it’s uncomfortable

Give 100% attention when interacting with others

Make sure we understand requirements before taking action.

Address everything a stakeholder brings up

Come to the conversation with as much preemptive knowledge as possible

Understanding the user’s challenges/needs will help you prepare for what they may ask

# 06-28-23
## Current projects

For now just stay focused of Store Reports QoL

There isn’t anything further for you to do on the Warehouse UPS project right now, I’ll let you know when we have some next steps

Google Drive: Because we are paying so much for Google now and Microsoft would be very expensive, Sabrina wants IT to focus on leveraging Google Docs and Sheet as replacement for form templates as the primary solution. Apps will be the answer for when a form has too much complexity or would benefit from the workflow improvements of an app. No Google Drive tasks for the Dev team right, now but they will likely be coming to help with research, implementation, and documentation.

In the mean time we have the project backlog to focus on. Loren and I are in the process of evaluating priorities. Again.

  

## Feedback

### From management to you:

Make sure things like the Excel AI tool go through IT management. We are going to come across cool thing and it’s hard not to share the excitement with the people that would use it, but Loren doesn’t like to be playing catch-up.

## Professional Development

Now that Randall is getting a pretty good dev speed with our tech stack he would like some dedicated training time to hone his knowledge. He didn’t have any specific topics during the meeting but will come up with a list and provide that to me.

## Any other issues or concerns

### Cleanliness

There has been an increase in roach spottings. We need to make sure we are cleaning crumbs and dirty dishes off our desks daily.

If you see a mess in the bathroom like overflowing trash cans or anything else, let Loren and Sabrina know so it can be addressed.

GitHub CoPilot:

- Activating Thursday
    - [https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot#installing-the-visual-studio-code-extension](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot#installing-the-visual-studio-code-extension)
- Gotchas to watch for
    - Review every variable name it provides. I have found that it will often generate in variable names that are very close, but incorrect; especially when it comes to object property names
- Feel free to use CoPilot Chat as well. Just know that it’s in public beta so bugs are more likely and will likely have additional cost when it is released. I don’t know if we will be approved for that additional cost.
- Expectations
    - You are still responsible for the end result. - Review all code generated.
    - You are still responsible for following code style standards.
    - CoPilot will suggest features and methods that you had not heard of. It’s awesome for getting exposure to things you didn’t know about before. But you need to be able to understand well enough explain to others if you are going to include it in the code.

  

Notion:

We are going to move project mgmt from Jira to Notion.

- It provides better collaboration and flexibility
- We’ll do a team meeting to demo how we should be using it once I have approval to onboard the Dev team.
- Feel free to create an account with your @bufex.com email now and start poking around at it.

MGMT team is currently working on 2024 vision plans

Loren feels the time has come to prep a separate vision plan for the dev team

High level goals on it will be things like:

Proactive responsive design for all apps and sites

Proactive ADA compliance for all apps and sites

We now how access to the tools to do so

I’m envisioning this being accomplished via a more incremental approach

When an app needs to be worked on, updating for ADA and Responsive will be considered for inclusion in the task

I.E. how Wes did the Type Script conversion

Over the next couple of months gather your thoughts on what is working well and what could be better with how dev team tasks are planned and managed.

Can you come up with any improvements to bring to the team?

What are pain points you have noticed?
