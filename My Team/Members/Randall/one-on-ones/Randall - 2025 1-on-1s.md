## Current projects

What has been working well? Is there anything getting in your way or any additional support you need?

  

Projects are going well, want’s to know what’s next but understands that we don’t have exact plans since Loren has been out.

We did talk about how as the year goes on we will likely get more office template conversion projects.

## Feedback

### From management to you:

### Your feedback for me (about me or the team in general):

## Any other issues or concerns

Dev Team Sustainability

- It is unlikely that we will be adding any additional devs for some time
- To help our workload we will need to enable the techs to support further before coming to us.
    - To do this we need to start documenting the issues that they come to us with
    - We will track this in Notion as a project
