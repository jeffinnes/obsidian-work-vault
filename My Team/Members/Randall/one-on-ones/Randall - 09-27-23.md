## Current projects

What has been working well? Is there anything getting in your way or any additional support you need?

BEEPD:

Almost ready for review

  

Vendor over/short tool > Celerant Toolkit TLC

  

## Feedback

### From management to you:

### Your feedback for me (about me or the team in general):

  

## Goals

How do you feel things are going regarding your goals from a few months ago?

- Get confident with Front-end dev
- Learn best practices with Next.js

  

## Professional Development

What are your short and long-term goals? How can we work together to help you meet them?

  

## Any other issues or concerns

GitHub CoPilot:

- Activating Thursday
    - [https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot#installing-the-visual-studio-code-extension](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot#installing-the-visual-studio-code-extension)
- Gotchas to watch for
    - Review every variable name it provides. I have found that it will often generate in variable names that are very close, but incorrect; especially when it comes to object property names
- Feel free to use CoPilot Chat as well. Just know that it’s in public beta so bugs are more likely and will likely have additional cost when it is released. I don’t know if we will be approved for that additional cost.
- Expectations
    - You are still responsible for the end result. - Review all code generated.
    - You are still responsible for following code style standards.
    - CoPilot will suggest features and methods that you had not heard of. It’s awesome for getting exposure to things you didn’t know about before. But you need to be able to understand well enough explain to others if you are going to include it in the code.

  

Notion:

We are going to move project mgmt from Jira to Notion.

- It provides better collaboration and flexibility
- We’ll do a team meeting to demo how we should be using it once I have approval to onboard the Dev team.
- Feel free to create an account with your @bufex.com email now and start poking around at it.
