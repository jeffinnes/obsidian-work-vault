## Current projects

What has been working well? Is there anything getting in your way or any additional support you need?

MPOP: It sounds like the scope is approved, review it in the department’s Google Drive and expand the “Build Out” item in the Notion project into the actual build-out tasks.

  

Keep me in the loop on your discussions with Steve regarding the data purge

  

## Feedback

### From management to you:

### Your feedback for me (about me or the team in general):

  

## Goals

What are your short and long-term goals? How can we work together to help you meet them?

  

## Professional Development

What are your short and long-term goals? How can we work together to help you meet them?

  

## Any other issues or concerns

Reminder from Loren: When you set something like a deploy script or something make sure to check that it was successful, no “set and forget”
