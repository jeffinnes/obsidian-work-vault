## Professional Development

Start looking into Typescript and Prisma. We can take an incremental adoption path for TS.

## Any other issues or concerns

Email templates:

Stand alone:

Better if we want to do really fancy things

  

Celerant toolkit:

Better if they are going to stay the same

  

Let’s also keep an eye out for opportunities to send drops from dev team. It’s easy to over look, but people do help us with our projects

We are now to a point where we need to tighten up our QA process. This mostly just means creating a testing checklist as part of each project, maybe it will be completed in Notion, or maybe we could utilize GitHub’s PR. But the first step is building an initial list.

Try to add some “gotchas” or test items to the brainstorm page in Notion. Context or real-world examples are also welcome.

When users ask for something from one of our apps, make sure to run it by mgmt before we jump on it. (Let us know the impact to) That way we can plan rolling the work together and not have daily update deployments.

CTK Moving Along

Olivia ACH fix

Next up will be the Mobile POP

Start researching how we can print tags from the browser to a bluetooth device

The tags don’t need to be very specific, just something like Item Category and price.

MPOP: It sounds like the scope is approved, review it in the department’s Google Drive and expand the “Build Out” item in the Notion project into the actual build-out tasks.

  

Keep me in the loop on your discussions with Steve regarding the data purge
