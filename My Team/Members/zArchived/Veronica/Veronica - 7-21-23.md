## Current projects

What has been working well? Is there anything getting in your way or any additional support you need?

  

## Feedback

### From management to you:

Keep Up good work on tickets

After you met with me and Sam on the 11th regarding punctuality, you did show immediate improvement for two days, but then it quickly crept back into the 7 - 8 minute grace period use.

Your 90-day eval is coming up which means it’s an important time in assessing job fit. After today, you no longer have your safety net.

Also if you have to pass through the UofA to get to work, start budgeting yourself more time, back to school gets wild for the first two months, and can easily add 10 minutes to the trip.

Sam has noticed on a few occasions that you have had earbuds in. When you are on lunch or break it’s definitely fine to use them. But since one of your main responsibilities as a tech is to respond to things they shouldn’t be used when you are working.

### Your feedback for me (about me or the team in general):

  

## Goals

What are your short and long-term goals? How can we work together to help you meet them?

  

## Professional Development

What are your short and long-term goals? How can we work together to help you meet them?

  

## Any other issues or concerns

There has been an increase in roach spottings. We need to make sure we are cleaning crumbs and dirty dishes off our desks daily.

If you see a mess in the bathroom like overflowing trash cans or anything else, let Loren and Sabrina know so it can be addressed.
