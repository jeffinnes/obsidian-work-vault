## Feedback

### From management to you:

When I asked for a modified version of the PKQ form you did a great job of checking the urgency, letting me know when it could be done, and keeping your agreement by having it ready for me to review quickly the next morning. Keep up that good communication.

  

Try not to swear even though Loren does

If we get too casual about it, it can slip out on the phone

Loren doesnâ€™t take calls

  

### Your feedback for me (about me or the team in general):

  

## Goals

What are your short and long-term goals? How can we work together to help you meet them?
