## Current projects

What has been working well? Is there anything getting in your way or any additional support you need?

  

## Feedback

### From management to you:

You are doing great!

If you know you have PTO coming up try and get your tasks done the day before or get someone to cover for you.

### Your feedback for me (about me or the team in general):

Is there a way to forward on-call calls?

On-call phone is getting old

What are some options for consolidating to one phone

## Goals

What are your short and long-term goals? How can we work together to help you meet them?

  

## Professional Development

I will need to talk to the rest of the mgmt team to see if the learning tasks I have in mind align with their agendas for the department.

  

## Any other issues or concerns
