## Current projects

What has been working well? Is there anything getting in your way or any additional support you need?

  

## Feedback

### From management to you:

Overall you are doing really well! Keep up the good work!

You seem to be meshing well with the team, just be mindful that friendly chat doesnâ€™t lead full on distraction or missed customer service items.

e.g. The other day you, Daniel, and Brian got chatting and it caused some emails to get missed for like an hour.

### Your feedback for me (about me or the team in general):

  

## Goals

What are your short and long-term goals? How can we work together to help you meet them?
