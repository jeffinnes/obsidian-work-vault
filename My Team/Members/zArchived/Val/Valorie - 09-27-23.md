### From management to you:

### Your feedback for me (about me or the team in general):

  

## Goals

What are your short and long-term goals? How can we work together to help you meet them?

**Staff Changes**

- Work with Brian and Daniel for training on the manual way for store operators first.
- Let Sam or I know if scheduling is an issue and we can plan a training time.

  

**Tech 1 Checklist**

- Provide a copy for self tracking if she does not already have one

## Professional Development

Now that youâ€™ve been at it for a bit, are there any areas you feel like you are struggling skill wise?

- DBMS
- Store wiring

## Any other issues or concerns

Mpos

- To many stores not enough Mpos
- Could the training tablets be a back up?
- Maybe we need to implement a request cut off limit
