## Current projects

How is progress on the inboard rebuild?

What can I do to help? Side by side? Roadmapping? Concept discussion?

  

Google Drive: Because we are paying so much for Google now and Microsoft would be very expensive, Sabrina wants IT to focus on leveraging Google Docs and Sheet as replacement for form templates as the primary solution. Apps will be the answer for when a form has too much complexity or would benefit from the workflow improvements of an app. No Google Drive tasks for the Dev team right, now but they will likely be coming to help with research, implementation, and documentation.

In the mean time we have the project backlog to focus on. Loren and I are in the process of evaluating priorities. again.

  

## Feedback

### From management to you:

We appreciate you stepping back into non-dev tasks.

Grace period use is still 16 events out of 19 workdays this month BUT I have noticed and Loren is pleased that the length of them has greatly improved

### Your feedback for me (about me or the team in general):

  

## Any other issues or concerns

Status on training Alex to lead PDQ?
