## Current projects

For now just stay focused of Store Reports QoL

There isn’t anything further for you to do on the Warehouse UPS project right now, I’ll let you know when we have some next steps

Google Drive: Because we are paying so much for Google now and Microsoft would be very expensive, Sabrina wants IT to focus on leveraging Google Docs and Sheet as replacement for form templates as the primary solution. Apps will be the answer for when a form has too much complexity or would benefit from the workflow improvements of an app. No Google Drive tasks for the Dev team right, now but they will likely be coming to help with research, implementation, and documentation.

In the mean time we have the project backlog to focus on. Loren and I are in the process of evaluating priorities. Again.

  

## Feedback

### From management to you:

Make sure things like the Excel AI tool go through IT management. We are going to come across cool thing and it’s hard not to share the excitement with the people that would use it, but Loren doesn’t like to be playing catch-up.

### Your feedback for me (about me or the team in general):

  

## Any other issues or concerns
