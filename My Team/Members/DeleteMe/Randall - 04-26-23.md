### Five points of power examples

Ask for what you want

Training, tools, projects, project timelines

Keep your agreements

Completing work detailed in the Scope

Follow-up communication

Having demos ready when agreed

If you need to follow-up on something from a discussion with stakeholder, follow-up asap or communicate the delay preemptively

Speak the truth

Discuss when mid-project requests cause scope creep

Let stakeholders know if a deliverable isn’t going to be met as early as possible

e.g. If a demo isn’t going to be 100% ready for some reason. The stakeholder may wish to postpone or may be okay with a partial demo, but it sets correct expectations.

Be accountable for your own experiences

Be honest when reflecting on why something didn’t get done correctly, on time, or “failed” (like a deployment issue or crashing app)

We can improve on truth, even if it’s uncomfortable

Give 100% attention when interacting with others

Make sure we understand requirements before taking action.

Address everything a stakeholder brings up

Come to the conversation with as much preemptive knowledge as possible

Understanding the user’s challenges/needs will help you prepare for what they may ask
