## Current projects

What has been working well? Is there anything getting in your way or any additional support you need?

## Feedback

### From management to you:

Your eval is coming soon.

### Your feedback for me (about me or the team in general):

  

## Goals

What are your short and long-term goals? How can we work together to help you meet them?

  

## Professional Development

  

## Any other issues or concerns

We are now to a point where we need to tighten up our QA process. This mostly just means creating a testing checklist as part of each project, maybe it will be completed in Notion, or maybe we could utilize GitHub’s PR. But the first step is building an initial list.

Try to add some “gotchas” or test items to the brainstorm page in Notion. Context or real-world examples are also welcome.
