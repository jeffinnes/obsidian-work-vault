## Current projects

What has been working well? Is there anything getting in your way or any additional support you need?

  

## Feedback

### From management to you:

### Your feedback for me (about me or the team in general):

  

## Goals

What are your short and long-term goals? How can we work together to help you meet them?

  

## Professional Development

Now that Randall is getting a pretty good dev speed with our tech stack he would like some dedicated training time to hone his knowledge. He didnâ€™t have any specific topics during the meeting but will come up with a list and provide that to me.

## Any other issues or concerns

### Cleanliness

There has been an increase in roach spottings. We need to make sure we are cleaning crumbs and dirty dishes off our desks daily.

If you see a mess in the bathroom like overflowing trash cans or anything else, let Loren and Sabrina know so it can be addressed.
