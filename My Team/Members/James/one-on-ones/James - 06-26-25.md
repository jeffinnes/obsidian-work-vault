## Current projects

What has been working well? Is there anything getting in your way or any additional support you need?

For the VPN speed issues

Need time to restart the GA firewall

July 4

  

We need to figure out the easiest way to onboard the Office 365 GA users into the cloud auth. GA deployment goal for 365 is the first week of August.

  

## Feedback

### From management to you:

### Your feedback for me (about me or the team in general):

Vending machine

## Goals

What are your short and long-term goals? How can we work together to help you meet them?

  

## Professional Development

Going forward we are going to set Pluralsight learning goals for the month. The goal is to put in a few hours each week. Ideally, we will start scheduling the training time.

If the MGMT team doesn’t have one to assign, or you have already completed what we assign, you will be free to pick a topic for mgmt to approve.

The point of this is to make sure we are actually getting value out of Pluralsight so Loren will be checking to see if it’s used.
