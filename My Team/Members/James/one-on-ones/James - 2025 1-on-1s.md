Dev Team Sustainability

- It is unlikely that we will be adding any additional devs for some time
- To help our workload we will need to enable the techs to support further before coming to us.
    - To do this we need to start documenting the issues that they come to us with
    - We will track this in Notion as a project

For the VPN speed issues > Need time to restart the GA firewall

## Professional Development

Going forward we are going to set Pluralsight learning goals for the month. The goal is to put in a few hours each week. Ideally, we will start scheduling the training time.

If the MGMT team doesn’t have one to assign, or you have already completed what we assign, you will be free to pick a topic for mgmt to approve.

The point of this is to make sure we are actually getting value out of Pluralsight so Loren will be checking to see if it’s used.

  For July: GitHub & TBD
