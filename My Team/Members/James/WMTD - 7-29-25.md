RE: 7/27 CA12 Internet outage and lack of communication/documentation

## What happened?
Laptop was at home when he made a quick trip to the store, but then his car wouldn't start and he was dealing with that when the call came in. He opened the ticket with Granite, but by the time he made it back home he forgot to follow up with the other things.


## Response
I confirmed that he understood the importance of communicating via emails and ticket notes so others could follow up. I also let him know that in a situation like that it is okay to contact the escalation manager for assistance handling the call.
