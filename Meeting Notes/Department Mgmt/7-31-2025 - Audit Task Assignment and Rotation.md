We are going to have Brian, Daniel, and James do the audit tasks that Loren does.
We will rotate the list through the three of them each month


Mgrs will keep the Bufex.com auditing

They are not responsible for delegating out addressing the issues. They are to report any issues to me and Steve so we can get the things addressed.
