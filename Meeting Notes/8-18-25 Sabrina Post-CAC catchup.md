## Agenda
Touch base on

- and more?

## Meeting Notes
- Consignment payable report
	- Drop a link to Sabrina
- EoM Template
	- Outlet transfers
		- Drop attachment and just make text fields
			- Count of boxes to which store
			- Each store feed one single outlet so all four will need to be drop down options
	- Scannable donations
		- Checkbox to confirm no scannable above notes
- Transfer logs (See OG 1.7.2) - Come up with ETA
	- Currently they don't have a good way to transfer to Acct
	- Eventually it could make sense to merge into backstock
	- Start as separate app but lay groundwork to merge
	- The order number could be duplicate
	- Need edit or delete
	- Separate ins from outs on the transfers page
	- Nav
		- Incoming
		- Outbound
- Backstock Log
	- Date box is made editable
	- Ability to note location (in store/offsite)
		- Checkbox in form
		- Color code light grey road
	- For the sort by box number request
		- We can't predict how people will number so sorting will be nearly impossible
		- We will sort by box date now that it will be editable
