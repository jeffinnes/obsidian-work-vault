# Goals / agenda

Initial meeting to discuss creating a customer-facing app for Buffalo

- Why do we want to build an app?
- What features should it have?
    - How would that feature work for the user?
- Are there any apps that have these features that we could use for inspiration?

# Discussion notes

- Why build the app?
    
- Feature wishlist
    - Provide wardrobe wallet style thing
        - Trade and SVC
    - Recent transaction history (Not really a must-have)
        - Maybe not purchase history but trade usage history would be good - still not must have
        - To add transactions to the customer's app for rewards we could let them scan a receipt
    - Rewards program
    - Customers Can Book Calendly Appointments
        - Push notification reminders?
    - Users can set home store for easy access to info/appointments
    - OAuth for user management so we don't have to get called
    - To prevent duplicate registrations of things, the app could check the DB first. This would probably need to be a first come first serve.
    - Feed-in Buffalo fashion coolness from Instagram
- Apps for inspiration
    - Starbucks style (Thanks Melissa!)
- Does Celerant have any examples of other companies providing gift card functionality in the app?
