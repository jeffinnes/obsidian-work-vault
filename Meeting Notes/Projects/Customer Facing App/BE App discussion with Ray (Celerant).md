# Goals / agenda

- Find out what other customers on v6.4 are doing for customer-facing apps like the one we want to build
- Specifically:
    - How are they making gift card, trade card, and transaction data available to the app
    - How are they handling the sync delay
    - Customer as a persistent entity

# Discussion notes

- Eco Chic
    - Customer record has a virtual card
    - Hosted in Celerant’s data facility
        - Celerant dedicated infrastructure
- Celerant does have experience with a CRM app
- Ray will send over some app examples
- Ray thinks our network is crap and should be intrusion tested
- Ray doesn’t think using their infrastructure as a DMZ is viable and “wouldn’t even want to bid on the project”
- In Stratus, cards are handled differently
