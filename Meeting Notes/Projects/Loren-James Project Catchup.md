# Discussion notes

- James recommends 9300 checkpoint
    - $45,000 (probably plus support costs)
- Still pricing out Vaults
    - Brief looking shows 25k should be good
- Small NAS units looking kinda like
    - $450 each ish
- Dev projects status
    - Labor cost is underway
    - Digital signage - Marketing has their login
        - He will make a new demo page
        - Loren would like to add: Include a webcam for leadership to have two way calls with the stores
            - We will hold off on this for now till the signage part is done.
    - Bad customer sharing thing
        - Area staff and store managers can add to it. Everyone else can read it. (Double check this with Sabrina)
    - Microsoft vs Linux costing
        - Gotta figure out what support level we want to go with.
- I sit through a lot of the same meetings twice

# Action items

- [x] For Odoo questions
    
    Cloud infra layout? Underlying platform?
    
    What does on-prem mean? Just one in Helen stack or replicated store servers?

    Have James add infra questions too.
