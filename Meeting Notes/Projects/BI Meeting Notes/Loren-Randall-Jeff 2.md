# Discussion notes

- Project status checkin
    - Prioritize the EOM Template
- The Celerant pw reset rebuild isn’t the highest priority
- BI Stuff
    - Hit one of Monica’s first then show to Rebecca (In progress)
    - Do one of RBs reports first
    - Loren is thinking we can go back and forth
    - For RB I can share that template site for inspo when appropriate
