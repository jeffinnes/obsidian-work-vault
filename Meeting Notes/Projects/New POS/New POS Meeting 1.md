# Goals / agenda

- Review the initial scope

# Discussion notes

- We need to update the summary to mention POS _and_ POP
- Need to make sure the system is able to handle our sku system (millions of unique skus)
- Add pin pad integration to wish list
    - But CC numbers are never stored in our system
- For inventory management
    - Distribution/Fulfillment Center Functionality
    - Include supply inventory
    - If we can get an ERM level option It would be great if AP processing was included
        - Currently POs are put in Celerant and AP has to record it in Dynamic
    - Open to Buy - Included would be idea, but a connector would be acceptable
    - EDI integration - high priority wishlist
        - It’s an old standard but it checks out
        - Is this being replaced with anything new?
    - Donations management
- Gift card functionality
    - Customer facing lookup
    - Accurate reporting of current company balances
- Payroll - Nice to have
    - Time clocks - Able to export and import into Celerant
- Reports
    - The exact reports will need to be be defined
    - Mktng - customer research reports
        - Customer segmentation to use in marketing communication workflows
- Intake
    - Mktng is interested in adjustable rates for individuals (Like influencers)
- Light wishlist item: CFD for POP
- Customer Records able to store DL picture
- RB Says:
    - Less siloing for stores in inventory
    - Returns/SKUs work across stores
- Sounds like we really need to go with cloud based to make our workflows work well
- Discounts
    - One off coupons for promos or customer service
- Clarify Sale discount (e.g. $5 coupon) vs item discount (e.g. markdowns)
- For Markdowns
    - New Merch - timer doesn’t start until the store has received the items
    - Aging date should really be when it “goes on the shelf”
- UPS integration
