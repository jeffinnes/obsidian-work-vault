# Goals / agenda

- Step through set up
    - How do we add locations?
- Plan next steps
- Can we lock down logins to IP addresses?

# Discussion notes

- She made stations that required
- We need to see what it looks like when someone assigns themself to a station
- We probably won’t start out with wait times and just do line length,
- If we want to try out wait times later, we can do so on a location basis
- For SMS set up
    - [https://developers.waitwhile.com/docs/using-your-own-twilio-account-for-sms](https://developers.waitwhile.com/docs/using-your-own-twilio-account-for-sms)
- We’ll do 4 stores to start, 1 test and 3 stores
- For wait times leave on on the waitlist, turn off on the welcome page config
- In registration flow, turn off show welcome
- Hanna is going to check on showing customers the wait list
- Store user set to editor
    - We can even create custom roles that inherit from pre-canned
- Hanna will follow up on finding out how to set up IP allowed logins
