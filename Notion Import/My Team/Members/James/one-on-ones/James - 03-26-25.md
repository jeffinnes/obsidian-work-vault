## Any other issues or concerns

Dev Team Sustainability

- It is unlikely that we will be adding any additional devs for some time
- To help our workload we will need to enable the techs to support further before coming to us.
    - To do this we need to start documenting the issues that they come to us with
    - We will track this in Notion as a project
