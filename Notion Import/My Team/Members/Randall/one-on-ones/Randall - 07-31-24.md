## Current projects

CTK Moving Along

Olivia ACH fix

Next up will be the Mobile POP

Start researching how we can print tags from the browser to a bluetooth device

The tags donâ€™t need to be very specific, just something like Item Category and price.

  

  

## Feedback

### From management to you:

### Your feedback for me (about me or the team in general):

  

## Goals

What are your short and long-term goals? How can we work together to help you meet them?

  

## Professional Development

  

  

## Any other issues or concerns

Just as a reminder we are giving everyone, stores have 72 hours to ship back equipment and get us the tracking number.
