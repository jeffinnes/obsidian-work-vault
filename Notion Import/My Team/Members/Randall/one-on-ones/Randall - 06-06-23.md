## Current projects

What has been working well? Is there anything getting in your way or any additional support you need?

- Nemo modifications status?
    - Put bug fix changes tax branch and then merge tax branch
    - Will the documentation need to be updated
- What else do you need to get done dev/non-dev to start on store report QoL fixes?
    - Nothing else is blocking this other than things Steve needs to work on and the generally heightened workload.
- I Need to discuss the priorities of the next projects with Loren
