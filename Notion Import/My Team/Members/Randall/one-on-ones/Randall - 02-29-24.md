## Current projects

What has been working well? Is there anything getting in your way or any additional support you need?

Emergency alert worked and Loren just approved it to be deployed. We will test next week.

  

Upcoming ada and email templates

## Feedback

### From management to you:

### Your feedback for me (about me or the team in general):

  

## Goals

What are your short and long-term goals? How can we work together to help you meet them?

  

## Professional Development

Start looking into Typescript and Prisma. We can take an incremental adoption path for TS.

## Any other issues or concerns

Email templates:

Stand alone:

Better if we want to do really fancy things

  

Celerant toolkit:

Better if they are going to stay the same

  

Let’s also keep an eye out for opportunities to send drops from dev team. It’s easy to over look, but people do help us with our projects
