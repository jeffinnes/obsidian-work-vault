## Current projects

What has been working well? Is there anything getting in your way or any additional support you need?

What is left to do on the Inboard?

Admin page / edit info

  

## Feedback

### From management to you:

I thought the phone use had been corrected, but Loren is still seeing you stash your phone at your side when he walks in. This is the last time I can make it a verbal warning. The next time he is making it a written warning.

Itâ€™s hard for me to defend project delays due to difficulty if the perception is that the issue is a cell distraction and Word docs getting snapped closed whenever someone walks by.

### Your feedback for me (about me or the team in general):

  

## Goals

For next month:

- Get in the inboard deployed
- Start GA Phase of PPCR

  

What are your short and long-term goals? How can we work together to help you meet them?
