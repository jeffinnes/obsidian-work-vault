## Current projects

What has been working well? Is there anything getting in your way or any additional support you need?

  

AATT

What needs to be done for this to be testable (bugs are okay) next week?

Make sure all form labels are associated with the input item via the For/ID explicit binding

  

## Feedback

### From management to you:

  

### Your feedback for me (about me or the team in general):

Jared, seems to be struggling getting through any tickets on his own

  

## Goals

What are your short and long-term goals? How can we work together to help you meet them?

  

## Professional Development

## Any other issues or concerns

We are now at a point where we need to tighten up our QA process. This mostly just means creating a testing checklist as part of each project, maybe it will be completed in Notion, or maybe we could utilize GitHub’s PR. But the first step is building an initial list.

Try to add some “gotchas” or test items to the brainstorm page in Notion. Context or real-world examples are also welcome.
