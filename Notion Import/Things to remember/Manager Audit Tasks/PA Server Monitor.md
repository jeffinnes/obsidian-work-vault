# Task things

- Check to see if things are disabled that shouldn’t be
    - We will really need to open all of them to see if things are disabled
- Check for Status counts that aren’t “okay”
    - Yellow “alert”
    - Gray “other”
- Kick over the team to address any issues
- Look for things that are disabled, find out why
- Make sure things get cleaned out
