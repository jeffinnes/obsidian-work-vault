# 10/22/2024

## Goals / agenda

- Mobile app
    - By December 31, 2024, UKG will automatically activate the new UKG Pro app for organizations currently using UKG Pro Classic and/or UKG Dimensions apps if they haven't already activated it themselves.
    - As of January 1, 2025, UKG will discontinue support, updates, and incident management for legacy apps (UKG Pro Classic, UKG Dimensions, and UKG Talk).
    - By March 2025, all legacy apps will be removed from app stores, requiring all users to transition to the new UKG Pro mobile app to avoid potential performance and functionality issues.
    - Use Testing Role for other features?
- Mass Erasure
- Wallet?

## Discussion notes

- Mass Erasure
    - Single delete feature for Mass Erasure
        - Enter emp ID, add to purge queue, output UKG ready CSV
    - How often to do the delete?
    - Currently we have a backlog of thousands. We can only do 500 at a time. But it looks like we can do multiple per day.

    - Next steps are
        - Verify app
        - Run through process and finish docs
        - Figure out frequency
        - Decide how to do approvals
    - Steve will work out the next part with HR

    - There is no way to get notified of consent of direct deposit
    - Dec rollout is in question because UKG is slow

# 6/14/24

## Goals / agenda

## Discussion notes

Reviewing status of privacy manager

Steve presented his project plan for the Privacy Manager workflows

Sabrina is sure that we canâ€™t hold any identifiable info so there really isnâ€™t a reason to maintain an audit DB for the downstream automation processes

Payroll should test their reports after the first purge

Payroll will also need to look at purging their physical records

Steve and Amy added the supervisor field so it can be edited in the web portal

Now it can be set during intake

No longer need back office for this ðŸŽŠ

Steve talked about some training he did - Tyler also did it

Not sure why he brought the packet from the class though, I missed what he said about that

Tyler has been working on moving as much to portal from BO as possible

UKG Wallet

Linda has reviewed all of the contracts and is working with lawyers

Itâ€™s possible that Linda will have contracts ready for RB to review soon

Linda mentioned this is an API integration. what?

**This is a UKG integration thatâ€™s already built Iâ€™ll just need to help wire it up**

New PTO Code

They are looking at buttons being redeemable for PTO

Before we will do a sandbox we need to create a laundry list of process improvements

Next meeting will be called by Steve/Jennifer. This will be a remote meeting unless in-person is justified.
