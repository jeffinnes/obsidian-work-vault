# Goals / Agenda

- Decide how the flow should go

# Discussion notes

- We have decided that for non-visual things Josh can just implement them on the live site after testing in the staging site
- For visual things he will let us know when he needs them reviewed and once we approve them on the staging site he will implement them in prod
- Commune is estimating around 3 months to complete

# Action items

- [ ] Set up ADA copy of the site for Josh to work on
