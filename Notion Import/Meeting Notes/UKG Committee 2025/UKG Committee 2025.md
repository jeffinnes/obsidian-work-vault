## Goals / agenda

- This was a UKG webinar regarding the discontinuation of back office
- Find out what is going to happen with SMC

## Discussion notes

- UKG is rolling out GenAI agents called Bryte
    - How in the what does this have to do with back office???
    - Blah blah more AI Stuff
    - Oh okay they are doing some refresh stuff for Pro Webâ€™s UI
        - This was not related to the GenAI stuff
- Holy smokes more AI stuff come onnnnn
- Oh okay allegedly this was all to set up why they need to discontinue it
- I asked my question directly because they were still talking about AI
