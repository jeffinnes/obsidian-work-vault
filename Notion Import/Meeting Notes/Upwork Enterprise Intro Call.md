# Goals / agenda

- Meet with Ryan from Upwork to learn about their enterprise product
- Find out if this would be a good fit for our current and potential need
    - Crystal Report Mod
    - Later, maybe Next.js/Node project help?
- Costs?
- Are there any minimum usage requirements?
    - Unclear how much we would actually make use of it in the short term.

# Discussion notes

- This was mostly an info-gathering call for them to see if it made sense to do a bigger call with the enterprise team
