## My questions:

- Do buttons need a different styles between hover, focus, and active state? Or is it just the outline focus indicator that needs to have 3:1 contrast?
    
- Will removing Read More (BUF_0063, BUF_0068) from the blog cards cause an issue where it wonâ€™t be clear that the user needs to click on the card to read the article or will the <a> tag in the card be the thing that communicates this to screen readers?
    - Should be okay to remove, they can re-test

  

Is NVDA openly available?

Yup!
