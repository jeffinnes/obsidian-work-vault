# Goals / agenda

- Find out what Keith liked about Odoo
- Is that what this meeting is about? I think this is actually a pitch meeting for Loren.
    - Yeah it mostly was trying to convince Keith to get on-board, but he was already on board
    - Also to outline how he thinks this will go down

# Discussion notes

- Stuff Keith Wants
    - Looking for better visibility on the PO life cycle
        - What’s been ordered, what’s shipping, when is it shipping, when is it arriving?
    - WooCommerce replacement
