# Goals / agenda

- Build a tool for reviewing that data and triggering an email to Monica
    - We would need SQL integration
        - Scan-it has a SQL integration tool for the app to scan
- End: Generate an email to Monica
- Monica doesnâ€™t need an automated update tool at this time

  

One day we might get to pre know delivers are inbound so we could pre-load things into the DB

Reporting for Monica could be useful

Keith can think of what reporting would be useful

  

  

  

As a separate thing, they get a CSV from UPS that says they received items and what this shipping cost was.

Lanae has a macro that runs on the CSV to create a pivot table report that can be audited

The pivot table is for research and reviewing adjustments and that shipments came in The CSV has multiple line items for a single tracking number

The macro also adds that data to a log which is then copied to a tab that auto-populates a payment auth.
