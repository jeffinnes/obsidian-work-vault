# Goals / agenda

- Gather info on the retirement of Touchbase Web clocks and replacement options
- Discuss Future of UTM
- Connections conference topics?

# Discussion notes

- No direct replacement for web clocks
    - Can use the emp login page
    - Mobile app
    - Or get a physical clock (This is realistically the only option)
- Physical clocks have physical Cat5e/cat6 (PoE) and WiFi network built-in
    - A handful of options available
        - Subscription and Full purchase payment models are available
        - Subscription includes next day air replacements
        - Purchase is $2600 + $500/year maintenance fee per year
- Mobile App might be worth it at GA and area offices
- If we want to move away from UTM to a Kronos legacy product if the time clock options are more reasonable.
- UKG Ready usually has a 30 to 90 day lead time to go live
