Ch 4 - see your blind spots

### My Thoughts (pre-meeting):

- Other’s will count the emotion in our reaction more that we will.
- We attribute our actions to the situation, but others are likely to attribute it to our character. (because they are dumb and have bad opinions)
- Our internal story is shaped by our intentions, but the story others have is shaped by the impacts our actions had

### My Thoughts (pre-meeting):

- Intro
    - The comments about how exhausting it is having to walk on egg shells with someone who would only get defensive and argue when getting feedback rings especially true for my relationship just after HS
- Three Triggers
    - In life, being open to even the idea of having blindspots was a huge step for me, but once I was able to, it made hearing how I could do better sting much less. Example, Stephanie had a laundry list of things I should do differently with the TucsonJS social media. I was and still am a bit insecure about how well I’m doing with it and if I wasn’t able to be open to hearing it, I would still be missing some pretty helpful information from someone that knows how to do it much better.
    - I’ve definitely noticed a marked change in the last 5-6 years where getting feedback about how I could have done or approached something differently (when presented in a good-faith way) is less threatening .
        - In some cases, it’s even frustrating when feedback isn’t available. Like programming calls I’ve had to make where I’m the subject matter expert and everyone else gives a “sounds good” because it does, and maybe even is.
- Truth Triggers
    - I have two sections in my one-on-ones dedicated to feedback — Us to them and them to me/us. I hadn’t considered the different kinds of feedback so according to this, I should not only deliver the feedback but also be explicit about which of the three kinds it is.
- First Understand
    - The general labels, even when the feedback is taken, can lead to incorrect understanding between the two
    - Spot the label
    - Seek to understand what data and the feedback/label is based on and what interpretation of that data led to the feedback/label
        - This could be hard because the giver is not always aware of the specifics of what they witnessed
    - Figure out specifically where the giver thinks the feedback is going. Don’t just assume you know their expected outcome.
    - I like the way they frame finding out more about the other person’s perspective by first looking for what’s different between the different people’s understanding and perspective.
    - The story they presented at the end of this section really highlights what I think is a big takeaway from the book so far. **When in feedback situations, it’s best if we set aside the urge to problems solve. Instead, we should take a deliberate mindset to just gather info and understand what the other person is thinking. We can accept or reject the feedback later from a more informed position.**
        - I think there is also an argument to be made for not creating an environment where feedback meetings end with us pressing the receiver to come up with a solution on the spot.
        - Communicating our reactions to the discussion is fine as long as it doesn’t shut down the conversation.
