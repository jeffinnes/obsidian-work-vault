# Goals / agenda

- Discuss a Google Drive template?
- With Sabrina, Jade, Juliet

# Discussion notes

- There are new com forms that need to go into Google Drive
- Jade and Juliet will make the final templates available to Sabrina and me, and then Judy will remake them this week ideally.
- Somewhere down the road they want to rollout example com forms that cant be edited.
    - I suggested PDF versions of them
    - Approval and all that is TBD
- Once Judy is done and these are in place we will let Jade know and she will handle telling everyone else.
