# Goals / agenda

- What is the long term direction for the dev team
- How do we handle the staffing and skill up issue
    - We can’t hire directly into dev 1 and it takes 2+ years to get someone in that position IF our techs are interested
        - Even if we could hire directly into the position we can’t reasonably train someone to be a dev and tech at the same time
        - Someone already qualified to be a dev will not be interested in tech work

# Discussion notes

Long term possible tasks.

- BI
- The AI
- Item movement intelligence
    - Monica
- Pricing research tool
- AI travel tool?

  

No long term solution for the staffing problem

Short term, I can tag James in as much as he can handle
