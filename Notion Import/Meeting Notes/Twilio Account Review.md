# Goals / agenda

- Review our account as requested by David via email

> Reaching out as we've seen consistent usage and want to check in to ensure everything is running smoothly on your end. We're excited that you chose Twilio to build with and want to be partners in your continued growth.
> 
> Currently, about **2,500** **SMS** over the past 30 days are currently being undelivered to the intended recipients. Luckily, the majority of these errors are 30003 or 30005, which are simply attempts to send SMS to landlines or incorrect numbers.
> 
> Additionally, at the level your usage is at, we can move to volume-based pricing that will result in substantial savings moving forward.
> 
> When would you have time to connect and review this with me?
