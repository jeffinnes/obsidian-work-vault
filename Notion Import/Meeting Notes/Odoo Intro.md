# Goals / agenda

- Find out more about Odoo
    - And if it can fit our needs
- How does on-prem work?
    - Like our local apps or just a single instance?

# Discussion notes

- Dominique Caldwell is the solutions engineer on mid market team
- TJ Quinn is sales on mid market team

  

- Odoo is priced per user but a user COULD be a “terminal” if individual user login
    - The main log-in would be done by a mgr at the beginning of the day
    - Individuals could then use a pin number so we know which employee does what
- Don’t necessarily need Excel connector to get data imported
    - The implementation team would be able to help us get our data in
- Implementation bills on time and materials
    - They would scope out implementation and quote us
- If we don’t pay for a maintenance, when updates come
    - We will need to handle the code mods and stuff and manually upgrade
- Odoo supports the last three versions
- There is the capability to have dev and staging branches set up for lab testing
- In the past, other customers have ended up using the Procurement system for purchasing used items by issuing a PO
- We’ll need to really evaluate the buy process with them to see if that module will work or if we will need a custom solution made
