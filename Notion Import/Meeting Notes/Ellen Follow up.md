I appreciate your apology for how you brought your concerns to me. That being said, we still need to address some things.

  

Since it still hasn’t been directly acknowledged - Now that you have had time away to think about things, do you understand what I said about where your attention is in the meeting and why it’s important?

  

  

I understand why changes and such can feel frustrating and pointed at you when you are not privy to every conversation and consideration.

As I mentioned when we met in person, we do appreciate your feedback about things you witness in the department but we cannot act on it if that knowledge is withheld. Again, you need to understand that for privacy, you will often never know what becomes of that feedback or know what goes into the decisions we have to make.

  

There are things that when taken in combination are signaling a frustrating level of disengagement.

- The side conversations during the meetings
- Excessive chatting with Valorie
- Responding to the mild correction with deflection to what others are doing instead of taking accountability and acknowledging your own actions
- And the ongoing constant overuse of the grace period that we have addressed many times

  

We have invested a lot of training time and resources into your development here in addition to accommodating your school schedule, minimizing your travel, and providing very flexible project goals. The displayed disengagement makes us question why we are going to those lengths.

  

[See how things go from here]

  

We will have a follow-up meeting either later today or tomorrow.

  

  

Ellen’s response was mostly that she feels singled out and like we are bringing all this up in retaliation. We did out best to assure her that it is call coming to a head now because of her reaction to the correction but not as retaliation. It has now become clear it needs to be addressed in this way.

She brought up that she feels like she has seen lots of things allowed to slide which prompted me to ask why she didn’t speak up. We cannot address what we aren’t aware of. She didn’t want to feel like the bad guy for calling people out.

She feels she has been trying to be better about some of those things.
