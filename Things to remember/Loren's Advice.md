(These were copied from Loren's notes that he handed to me to read. Mostly verbatum.)
1. Budgeting - Go high! Don't ask their opinion of hardware except for some items. ALWAYS have a "best" option to help Narrow!! Use my Forecast
2. Watch out for hiring strong orange. Don't ever settle!!
3. STAY in Control - Small shifts
4. Develop relations w/ Area Mgrs - Ask for feedback, include in Laptop requirements. Don't be timid you are EQUAL. Ask for feedback with form, so easy to answer
5. Continue our traditions! Ice cream day (none for AZ01). Halloween reverse trick or treat. Gingerbread house or something for holidays.
	1. Retire T-Rex but start another
6. Compare our PIs (Mine and Loren's?)
7. New POS project - Drive hard for "The Best". Don't let them think only POS. Future is Odoo like! Could save money which could reduce other GA costs.
8. Network store speeds 500MB is enough. At some point it's not worth more money.
9. Transition to cloud for Data Storage and backups. Reduce servers
10. Start getting Brian ready for promo. I have already laid the ground work with agreement.
