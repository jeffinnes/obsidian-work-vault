## Buffalo Website update flow

1. Jeff syncs staging from prod
2. Commune reviews and applies updates then tests site functionality (various pages and job application flow)
    
    If anything is wrong Commune remediates or flags an update as an issue to research so we skip it in production
    
3. Jeff enables the ATS redirect
4. Jeff backs up production
5. Commune applies patches in production
6. Commune performs tests again in production
